Certainly! I'll modify the code to implement dynamic scaling of the container pool. This will allow the system to adjust the number of containers based on the current workload. We'll add methods to scale up when the pool is running low on available containers and scale down when there are too many idle containers.
Let's update the ContainerPool and TenantRouter structures to support this functionality:

Now, let's go through the key changes and additions:

ContainerPool struct:

Added fields for minimum and maximum container counts, idle threshold, and scaling-related channels.
Introduced a mutex for thread-safe operations on the container pool.


NewContainerPool function:

Now takes minimum and maximum container counts as parameters.
Initializes the pool with the minimum number of containers.
Starts a goroutine for periodic scaling checks.


scaleContainers method:

Runs periodically to check and adjust the container count.


adjustContainerCount method:

Checks if the current container count is within the desired range.
Scales up if below the minimum, scales down if above the maximum.
Removes idle containers if the count is within range but some containers have been idle for too long.


scaleUp and scaleDown methods:

Handle the creation and removal of containers to adjust the pool size.


GetContainer and ReleaseContainer methods:

Updated to track the last usage time of containers.


Stop method for ContainerPool:

Stops the scaling goroutine and removes all containers.


TenantRouter:

Updated to use the new ContainerPool with dynamic scaling.



These changes implement a dynamic scaling mechanism for the container pool:

The pool starts with a minimum number of containers.
Every 30 seconds, it checks the current container count and usage.
If the count is below the minimum, it creates new containers.
If the count is above the maximum, it removes excess containers.
If the count is within range, it checks for containers that have been idle for more than 5 minutes and removes them if the count is above the minimum.

This approach allows the system to adapt to varying workloads:

During high load, it can scale up to the maximum number of containers.
During low load, it can scale down to the minimum number of containers, removing idle ones to save resources.

To test this new functionality, you could add a new unit test that simulates varying workloads over time and checks if the container pool scales appropriately. You might also want to add some logging or metrics to track how the pool scales in your production environment.
