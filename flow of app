This diagram illustrates the main components and flow of the application:

Incoming Data: The entry point for data into the system.
TenantRouter: Responsible for routing data to appropriate channels.
Channel Selection: Uses consistent hashing to determine which channel to use.
Worker Pools: Multiple worker pools process data concurrently.
Container Pool: Manages a pool of Docker containers for processing.
Docker Container: Where the actual data processing occurs.
Process Output: Handles the results from the container.
Circuit Breaker: Monitors failures and can trip to prevent overload.
Work Stealing: Balances load across worker pools.

The diagram shows how data flows through the system, from input to processing and output, including the load balancing and fault tolerance mechanisms in place.
