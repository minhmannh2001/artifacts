Certainly! I'll recommend some alternatives to goCelery and Machinery for task queuing, as well as some libraries that can help with multi-tenancy in Go applications.
Task Queue Libraries:

Asynq
Asynq is a Go library for queueing tasks and processing them asynchronously with workers. It's built on top of Redis and designed to be simple yet scalable.

Goque
Goque is an embedded, persistent, FIFO queue package for Go. It's not a distributed queue like Machinery, but it's excellent for local task queuing and processing.
Faktory
Faktory is a language-agnostic persistent background job server. It has official worker libraries for various languages, including Go.

Multi-tenancy Libraries:

go-multitenancy
This library provides a set of tools and utilities for building multi-tenant applications in Go.

gorm-multitenancy
If you're using GORM for database operations, gorm-multitenancy provides multi-tenancy support for GORM.
tenant
This is a simple package for multi-tenancy support in Go applications. It provides middleware for tenant identification and context management.

When choosing a library, consider your specific requirements:

For task queuing:

If you need a simple, Redis-based solution with good performance, Asynq might be a good choice.
If you prefer an embedded solution, Goque could work well.
If you need a language-agnostic solution, consider Faktory.


For multi-tenancy:

go-multitenancy provides a comprehensive set of tools for multi-tenant applications.
If you're using GORM, gorm-multitenancy could integrate well with your existing code.
For a lightweight solution, the tenant package might suffice.



Remember to evaluate these libraries based on their documentation, community support, recent updates, and compatibility with your existing architecture. Also, consider your specific multi-tenancy model (shared database, schema-based, or database-per-tenant) when choosing a multi-tenancy solution.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these libraries or provide more detailed examples of their usage?
