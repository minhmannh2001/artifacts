func (c *Poller) Start() error {
    // Existing initialization code...

    // Initialize and start DLQ consumer
    dlqConsumer := dlq.NewDLQConsumer(kafkaRepo, ingestor.NewIngestor(
        viper.GetString("soar_api.base_url"),
        viper.GetString("soar_api.api_key"),
        5,
        2,
    ))
    
    go func() {
        ctx := context.Background()
        dlqConsumer.Start(ctx)
    }()

    // Rest of the existing code...
}

This implementation provides:
Reliable error handling with DLQ mechanism
Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
Tracking of failed alerts with metadata
Separate consumer for processing failed alerts
Job status updates reflecting DLQ routing
Monitoring capabilities for failed alerts
Key features:
Failed alerts are sent to a dedicated Kafka topic
Retries are attempted with exponential backoff
Maximum retry attempts are enforced
Full error context is preserved
Job status is updated to reflect DLQ routing
Separate consumer handles retry logic
Would you like me to explain any part in more detail or provide additional implementation aspects?
